## Projects using ZIO

- [Rudder](https://github.com/normation/rudder): an example about how to manage error ADT in several sub-projects and specialized sub-domains, and how one can gradually contextualize error messages in domain layers. Uses queues, brackets, interop with Java, and historical code. See [context and references](https://issues.rudder.io/issues/14870).
- [ZIO AI Platform Backend](https://github.com/Clover-Group/zio_front): Clover Group AI Platform backend, which employs ZIO, Doobie, http4s and Kafka .
- [Polynote](https://github.com/polynote/polynote): a new, polyglot notebook with first-class Scala support, Apache Spark integration, multi-language interoperability including Scala, Python, and SQL, as-you-type autocomplete, and more.

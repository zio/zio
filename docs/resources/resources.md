## Projects using ZIO

- [Rudder](https://github.com/normation/rudder): an example about how to manage error ADT in several sub-projects and specialized sub-domains, and how one can gradually contextualize error messages in domain layers. Also use queues, brackets, interrop with Java and historical code... [Context and references explained in that ticket](https://issues.rudder.io/issues/14870).

Schedules allow you to define and compose flexible recurrence schedules, which can be used to repeat actions, or retry actions in the event of errors. Schedules are used in the following functions:

 * **Repetition**
   * `IO#repeat` — Repeats an effect until the schedule is done.
   * `IO#repeatOrElse` — Repeats an effect until the schedule is done, with a fallback for errors.
   * `IO#repeatOrElse0` — Repeats an effect until the schedule is done, with a more powerful fallback for errors.
 * **Retries**
   * `IO#retry` – Retries an effect until it succeeds.
   * `IO#retryOrElse` — Retries an effect until it succeeds, with a fallback for errors.
   * `IO#retryOrElse0` — Retries an effect until it succeeds, with a more powerful fallback for errors.

Schedules define stateful, possibly effectful, recurring schedules of events, and compose in a variety of ways.

A `Schedule[R, A, B]` consumes input values of type `A` (errors in the case of `retry`, or values in the case of `repeat`), and based on these values and internal state, decides whether to recur or conclude. Every decision is accompanied by a (possibly zero) delay, indicating how much time before the next recurrence, and an output value of type `B`.

## Base Schedules

```scala mdoc:invisible
import zio.duration._
```

A schedule that always recurs:

```scala mdoc:silent
val forever = Schedule.forever
```

A schedule that recurs 10 times:

```scala mdoc:silent
val upTo10 = Schedule.recurs(10)
```

A schedule that recurs every 10 milliseconds:

```scala mdoc:silent
val spaced = Schedule.spaced(10.milliseconds)
```

A schedule that recurs using exponential backoff:

```scala mdoc:silent
val exponential = Schedule.exponential(10.milliseconds)
```

A schedule that recurs using fibonacci backoff:

```scala mdoc:silent
val fibonacci = Schedule.fibonacci(10.milliseconds)
```

## Schedule Combinators

Applying random jitter to a schedule:

```scala mdoc:silent
val jitteredExp = Schedule.exponential(10.milliseconds).jittered
```

Modifies the delay of a schedule:

```scala mdoc:silent
val boosted = Schedule.spaced(1.second).delayed(_ => 100.milliseconds)
```

Combines two schedules sequentially, by following the first policy until it ends, and then following the second policy:

```scala mdoc:silent
val sequential = Schedule.recurs(10) andThen Schedule.spaced(1.second)
```

Combines two schedules through intersection, by recurring only if both schedules want to recur, using the maximum of the two delays between recurrences:

```scala mdoc:silent
val expUpTo10 = Schedule.exponential(1.second) && Schedule.recurs(10)
```

Combines two schedules through union, by recurring if either schedule wants to
recur, using the minimum of the two delays between recurrences:

```scala mdoc:silent
val expCapped = Schedule.exponential(100.milliseconds) || Schedule.spaced(1.second)
```

Stops retrying after a specified amount of time has elapsed:

```scala mdoc:silent
val expMaxElapsed = (Schedule.exponential(10.milliseconds) >>> Schedule.elapsed).whileOutput(_ < 30.seconds)
```

Retry only when a specific exception occurs:

```scala mdoc:silent
import scala.concurrent.TimeoutException

val whileTimeout = Schedule.exponential(10.milliseconds) && Schedule.recurWhile[Throwable] {
  case _: TimeoutException => true
  case _ => false
}
```

The ZIO library lets you easily solve problems in a variety of areas, including:

 - **Asynchronous Programming** — Write asynchronous code as easily as synchronous code, handling all errors and never leaking resources.
 - **Concurrent Programming** — Write concurrent code that scales easily, without locks or deadlocks, with maximal laziness and resource safety.
 - **Parallelism** — Trivially partition work among many parallel fibers to make short work of CPU-intensive processing.
 - **Queuing** — Build work processing flows and ration scarce resources with powerful asynchronous queues.
 - **Retrying** — Create and test robust retry strategies that make your application resilient to transient failures.
 - **Scheduling** — Schedule repeating work, like report generation or email notifications, using flexible, composable schedules.
 - **Streaming** — Handle huge or infinite amounts of data in constant heap space with efficient, lazy, concurrent streams.
 - **Testing** - Easily test effectual programs with powerful combinators, built-in property based testing, and seamless mocking capabilities.

Explore the pages above and learn how the simple, powerful building blocks in ZIO help you solve problems in these critical areas.

/**
 * A `ZChannel[In, Env, Err, Out, Z]` is a nexus of I/O operations, which supports both reading and
 * writing. A channel may read values of type `In` and write values of type `Out`. When the channel
 * finishes, it yields a value of type `Z`. A channel may fail with a value of type `Err`.
 *
 * Channels are the foundation of ZIO Streams: both streams and sinks are built on channels.
 * Most users shouldn't have to use channels directly, as streams and sinks are much more convenient
 * and cover all common use cases. However, when adding new stream and sink operators, or doing
 * something highly specialized, it may be useful to use channels directly.
 *
 * Channels compose in a variety of ways:
 *
 *  - Piping. One channel can be piped to another channel, assuming the input type of the second
 *    is the same as the output type of the first.
 *  - Sequencing. The terminal value of one channel can be used to create another channel, and
 *    both the first channel and the function that makes the second channel can be composed into a
 *    channel.
 *  - Concating. The output of one channel can be used to create other channels, which are all
 *    concatenated together. The first channel and the function that makes the other channels can
 *    be composed into a channel.

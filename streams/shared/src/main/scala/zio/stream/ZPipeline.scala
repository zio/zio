/**
 * A `ZPipeline[Env, Err, In, Out]` is a polymorphic stream transformer.
 * Pipelines accept a stream as input, and return the transformed stream as
 * output.
 *
 * Pipelines can be thought of as a recipe for calling a bunch of methods on a
 * source stream, to yield a new (transformed) stream. A nice mental model is
 * the following type alias:
 *
 * {{{
 * type ZPipeline[Env, Err, In, Out] = ZStream[Env, Err, In] => ZStream[Env, Err, Out]
 * }}}
 *
 * This encoding of a pipeline with a type alias is not used because it does not
 * infer well. In its place, this trait captures the polymorphism inherent to
 * many pipelines, which can therefore be more flexible about the environment
 * and error types of the streams they transform.
 *
 * There is no fundamental requirement for pipelines to exist, because
 * everything pipelines do can be done directly on a stream. However, because
 * pipelines separate the stream transformation from the source stream itself,
 * it becomes possible to abstract over stream transformations at the level of
 * values, creating, storing, and passing around reusable transformation
 * pipelines that can be applied to many different streams.
 *
 * The most common way to create a pipeline is to convert a sink into a pipeline
 * (in general, transforming elements of a stream requires the power of a sink).
 * However, the companion object has lots of other pipeline constructors based
 * on the methods of stream.

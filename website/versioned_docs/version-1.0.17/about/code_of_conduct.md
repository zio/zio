title: "ZIO Code of Conduct"
---

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal
appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or
other such characteristics.

The ZIO project follows the [Scala Code of Conduct](https://www.scala-lang.org/conduct/), with
an additional clause regarding moderation that is detailed below. All participants, contributors and 
members are expected to follow the Scala Code of Conduct when discussing the project on the available 
communication channels. If you are being harassed, please contact us immediately so that we can support you.

## Moderation and Steering Committee
 
The ZIO project is moderated by the Steering Committee team members:

- Itamar Ravid [@iravid](https://github.com/iravid)
- John De Goes [@jdegoes](https://github.com/jdegoes)
- Kai [@neko-kai](https://github.com/neko-kai)
- Paul Shirshov [@pshirshov](https://github.com/pshirshov)
- Pierre Ricadat [@ghostdogpr](https://github.com/ghostdogpr)
- Wiem Zine El Abidine [@wi101](https://github.com/wi101)

The ZIO project requires that drastic moderation actions detailed in the code of 
conduct - for example, removing a user from the Gitter channel - be agreed upon
a group of over 2/3rds of the steering committee.

For any questions, concerns, or moderation requests please contact any member of
the project, or the people listed above.

## BDFL

In addition to the above, the ZIO project's BDFL (benevolent dictator for life) is
John De Goes (@jdegoes), owing to his original founding of the project and continued
investments in it. While John adheres to the same code of conduct as everyone else,
he is entitled to override moderation decisions made by the steering committee.

We do not take the BDFL position lightly, especially with regards to moderation. John
has consistently shown he is level-headed and able to handle conflict responsibly. Feel
free to reach out to any member of the steering committee, including John himself,
with any concern you might have.

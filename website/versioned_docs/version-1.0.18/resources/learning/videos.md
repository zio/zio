## ZIO Libraries
- [What Happens In ZIO Stays in ZIO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZZazYy0tWM) by Willem Vermeer — ZIO has excellent interoperability with http4s, Cats, Akka libraries, and more, and there are a number of posts and videos that help developers use ZIO with these great libraries. Yet, the question remains: can you develop a web service using ZIO libraries alone? In this talk, we'll explore the answer to this question directly. We'll start by creating an SMTP server using ZIO NIO, and then we'll add a frontend based on ZIO gRPC and Scala.js. Along the way, we'll leverage ZIO Config to externalize the configuration, as well as the ZLayer mechanism for dependency injection. Maybe we'll throw ZIO JSON into the mix, and at the end, we'll take a step back to appreciate how much is really possible gluing those ZIO components together! Finally, we'll conclude by discussing what's still left to be done to make ZIO a full-fledged competitor in the area of full-stack web service development

### ZIO Config
- [Easy Config For Your App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SrSKluyyKo) by Afsal Thaj (December 2020) — Managing application configuration can be quite challenging: we often have to support multiple data sources with overrides, including HOCON, system properties, environment variables, and more. We have to document our configuration so it is clear to IT and DevOps how to configure our applications. We have to do strong validation with error accumulation to ensure bad data is rejected and good error messages are generated for end-users. In this presentation, Afsal Thaj, the author of ZIO Config, shows attendees how to solve all of these problems in a composable and testable way. By separating the description of configuration from what must be done with the configuration, ZIO Config provides all standard features—including multiple data sources, data source overrides, documentation, and validation with error accumulation—for free. Come learn how to make your applications configurable in an easy way that will delight IT and DevOps and make it easy to change your applications over time.

### ZIO Prelude
- [SF Scala: Reimagining Functional Type Classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwmHgL9F_9Q) John A. De Goes and Adam Fraser (August 2020) — In this presentation, John A. De Goes and Adam Fraser introduce a new Scala library with a completely different factoring of functional type classes—one which throws literally everything away and starts from a clean slate. In this new factoring, type classes leverage Scala’s strengths, including variance and modularity. Pieces fit together cleanly and uniformly, and in a way that satisfies existing use cases, but enables new ones never before possible. Finally, type classes are named, organized, and described in a way that makes teaching them easier, without compromising on algebraic principles.
- [The Terror-Free Guide To Introducing Functional Scala At Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sinde_P7nmY) by Jorge Vasquez (December 2020) — Too often, our applications are dominated by boilerplate that's not fun to write or test, and that makes our business logic complicated. In object-oriented programming, classes and interfaces help us with abstraction to reduce boilerplate. But, in functional programming, we use type classes. Historically, type classes in functional programming have been very complex and confusing, partially because they import ideas from Haskell that don't make sense in Scala, and partially because of their esoteric origins in category theory. In this presentation, Jorge Vásquez presents a new library called ZIO Prelude, which offers a distinctly Scala take on Functional Abstractions, and you will learn how you can eliminate common types of boilerplate by using it. Come see how you can improve your happiness and productivity with a new take on what it means to do functional programming in Scala!
- [ZIO WORLD - ZIO Prelude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69ngoqVXKPI) by Jorge Vasquez (March 2020) — In this talk, Jorge Vasques discusses his work bringing refined newtypes to ZIO Prelude, which are working natively on Scala 3 with a beautiful syntax and DSL.

While it’s easy to develop a basic command-line application, building one that features rich help, forgiving parsing, bulletproof validation, shell completions, and a clean and beautiful appearance is quite challenging. In this talk, Aiswarya Prakasan, a contributor to ZIO CLI, will lead you on a journey to building powerful command-line applications in Scala. Through the power of composition and strong types, you will discover how to build type-safe command-line applications in just a few simple lines of code, which give you rich features of command-line applications like git.

### ZparkIO
- [Accelerating Spark with ZIO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWgVGzb5-H8) by Leo Benkel (December 2020) — Apache Spark is a powerful tool for distributed analytics but isn’t built to offer rich primitives for local parallelism. Yet, using local parallelism, it is possible to dramatically improve the performance of ML projects—for example, by fetching data sources in parallel. Historically, Scala projects have used Scala's Future for local parallelism, but increasingly, many projects have begun adopting ZIO as a better Future. Although powerful, ZIO is not easy to set up with Spark. In this talk, Leo will introduce an open-source library that handles all boilerplate so you can easily implement Spark and ZIO in your ML projects, and will then present detailed benchmarks showing how much additional performance can be obtained through local parallelism. Learn how to use ZIO to make Spark better and faster!

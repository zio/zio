/**
 * `TestClock` makes it easy to deterministically and efficiently test
 * effects involving the passage of time.
 *
 * Instead of waiting for actual time to pass, `sleep` and methods
 * implemented in terms of it schedule effects to take place at a given clock
 * time. Users can adjust the clock time using the `adjust` and `setTime`
 * methods, and all effects scheduled to take place on or before that time
 * will automatically be run in order.
 *
 * For example, here is how we can test `ZIO#timeout` using `TestClock`:
 *
 * {{{
 *  import zio.ZIO
 *  import zio.test.environment.TestClock
 *
 *  for {
 *    fiber  <- ZIO.sleep(5.minutes).timeout(1.minute).fork
 *    _      <- TestClock.adjust(1.minute)
 *    result <- fiber.join
 *  } yield result == None
 * }}}
 *
 * Note how we forked the fiber that `sleep` was invoked on. Calls to `sleep`
 * and methods derived from it will semantically block until the time is set
 * to on or after the time they are scheduled to run. If we didn't fork the
 * fiber on which we called sleep we would never get to set the time on the
 * line below. Thus, a useful pattern when using `TestClock` is to fork the
 * effect being tested, then adjust the clock time, and finally verify that
 * the expected effects have been performed.
 *
 * For example, here is how we can test an effect that recurs with a fixed
 * delay:
 *
 * {{{
 *  import zio.Queue
 *  import zio.test.environment.TestClock
 *
 *  for {
 *    q <- Queue.unbounded[Unit]
 *    _ <- q.offer(()).delay(60.minutes).forever.fork
 *    a <- q.poll.map(_.isEmpty)
 *    _ <- TestClock.adjust(60.minutes)
 *    b <- q.take.as(true)
 *    c <- q.poll.map(_.isEmpty)
 *    _ <- TestClock.adjust(60.minutes)
 *    d <- q.take.as(true)
 *    e <- q.poll.map(_.isEmpty)
 *  } yield a && b && c && d && e
 * }}}
 *
 * Here we verify that no effect is performed before the recurrence period,
 * that an effect is performed after the recurrence period, and that the
 * effect is performed exactly once. The key thing to note here is that after
 * each recurrence the next recurrence is scheduled to occur at the
 * appropriate time in the future, so when we adjust the clock by 60 minutes
 * exactly one value is placed in the queue, and when we adjust the clock by
 * another 60 minutes exactly one more value is placed in the queue.

/**
 * The `environment` package contains testable versions of all the standard ZIO
 * environment types through the [[TestClock]], [[TestConsole]],
 * [[TestSystem]], and [[TestRandom]] modules. See the documentation on the
 * individual modules for more detail about using each of them.
 *
 * If you are using ZIO Test and extending `RunnableSpec` a
 * `TestEnvironment` containing all of them will be automatically provided to
 * each of your tests. Otherwise, the easiest way to use the test implementations
 * in ZIO Test is by providing the `TestEnvironment` to your program.
 *
 * {{{
 * import zio.test.environment._
 *
 * myProgram.provideLayer(testEnvironment)
 * }}}
 *
 * Then all environmental effects, such as printing to the console or
 * generating random numbers, will be implemented by the `TestEnvironment` and
 * will be fully testable. When you do need to access the "live" environment,
 * for example to print debugging information to the console, just use the
 * `live` combinator along with the effect as your normally would.
 *
 * If you are only interested in one of the test implementations for your
 * application, you can also access them a la carte through the `make` method
 * on each module. Each test module requires some data on initialization.
 * Default data is included for each as `DefaultData`.
 *
 * {{{
 * import zio.test.environment._
 *
 * myProgram.provideM(TestConsole.make(TestConsole.DefaultData))
 * }}}
 *
 * Finally, you can create a `Test` object that implements the test interface
 * directly using the `makeTest` method. This can be useful when you want to
 * access some testing functionality without using the environment type.
 *
 * {{{
 * import zio.test.environment._
 *
 * for {
 *   testRandom <- TestRandom.makeTest(TestRandom.DefaultData)
 *   n          <- testRandom.nextInt
 * } yield n
 * }}}
 *
 * This can also be useful when you are creating a more complex environment
 * to provide the implementation for test services that you mix in.

  /**
   * `TestClock` makes it easy to deterministically and efficiently test
   * effects involving the passage of time.
   *
   * Instead of waiting for actual time to pass, `sleep` and methods implemented
   * in terms of it schedule effects to take place at a given clock time. Users
   * can adjust the clock time using the `adjust` and `setTime` methods, and all
   * effects scheduled to take place on or before that time will automically be
   * run in order.
   *
   * For example, here is how we can test `ZIO#timeout` using `TestClock:
   *
   * {{{
   *  import zio.ZIO
   *  import zio.duration._
   *  import zio.test.environment.TestClock
   *
   *  for {
   *    fiber  <- ZIO.sleep(5.minutes).timeout(1.minute).fork
   *    _      <- TestClock.adjust(1.minute)
   *    result <- fiber.join
   *  } yield result == None
   * }}}
   *
   * Note how we forked the fiber that `sleep` was invoked on. Calls to `sleep`
   * and methods derived from it will semantically block until the time is
   * set to on or after the time they are scheduled to run. If we didn't fork
   * the fiber on which we called sleep we would never get to set the time on
   * the line below. Thus, a useful pattern when using `TestClock` is to fork
   * the effect being tested, then adjust the wall clock time, and finally
   * verify that the expected effects have been performed.
   *
   * For example, here is how we can test an effect that recurs with a fixed
   * delay:
   *
   * {{{
   *  import zio.Queue
   *  import zio.duration._
   *  import zio.test.environment.TestClock
   *
   *  for {
   *    q <- Queue.unbounded[Unit]
   *    _ <- q.offer(()).delay(60.minutes).forever.fork
   *    a <- q.poll.map(_.isEmpty)
   *    _ <- TestClock.adjust(60.minutes)
   *    b <- q.take.as(true)
   *    c <- q.poll.map(_.isEmpty)
   *    _ <- TestClock.adjust(60.minutes)
   *    d <- q.take.as(true)
   *    e <- q.poll.map(_.isEmpty)
   *  } yield a && b && c && d && e
   * }}}
   *
   * Here we verify that no effect is performed before the recurrence period,
   * that an effect is performed after the recurrence period, and that the effect
   * is performed exactly once. The key thing to note here is that after each
   * recurrence the next recurrence is scheduled to occur at the appropriate time
   * in the future, so when we adjust the clock by 60 minutes exactly one value
   * is placed in the queue, and when we adjust the clock by another 60 minutes
   * exactly one more value is placed in the queue.

   * `TestConsole` provides a testable interface for programs interacting with
   * the console by modeling input and output as reading from and writing to
   * input and output buffers maintained by `TestConsole` and backed by a
   * `Ref`.
   *
   * All calls to `putStr` and `putStrLn` using the `TestConsole` will write
   * the string to the output buffer and all calls to `getStrLn` will take a
   * string from the input buffer. To facilitate debugging, by default output
   * will also be rendered to standard output. You can enable or disable this
   * for a scope using `debug`, `silent`, or the corresponding test aspects.
   *
   * `TestConsole` has several methods to access and manipulate the content of
   * these buffers including `feedLines` to feed strings to the input  buffer
   * that will then be returned by calls to `getStrLn`, `output` to get the
   * content of the output buffer from calls to `putStr` and `putStrLn`, and
   * `clearInput` and `clearOutput` to clear the respective buffers.
   *
   * Together, these functions make it easy to test programs interacting with
   * the console.

   * pseudo-random values just like `scala.util.Random` except that no internal
   * state is mutated. Instead, methods like `nextInt` describe state transitions
   * from one random state to another that are automatically composed together
   * through methods like `flatMap`. The random seed can be set using `setSeed`
   * and `TestRandom` is guaranteed to return the same sequence of values for any
   * given seed. This is useful for deterministically generating a sequence of
   * pseudo-random values and powers the property based testing functionality in
   * ZIO Test.
   *
   * In the second mode, `TestRandom` maintains an internal buffer of values that
   * can be "fed" with methods such as `feedInts` and then when random values of
   * that type are generated they will first be taken from the buffer. This is
   * useful for verifying that functions produce the expected output for a given
   * sequence of "random" inputs.
   *
   * {{{
   * import zio.random._
   * import zio.test.environment.TestRandom

   *   _ <- TestRandom.feedInts(4, 5, 2)
   *   x <- random.nextIntBounded(6)
   *   y <- random.nextIntBounded(6)
   *   z <- random.nextIntBounded(6)
   * } yield x + y + z == 11
   * }}}
   *
   * `TestRandom` will automatically take values from the buffer if a value of
   * the appropriate type is available and otherwise generate a pseudo-random
   * value, so there is nothing you need to do to switch between the two modes.
   * Just generate random values as you normally would to get pseudo-random
   * values, or feed in values of your own to get those values back. You can also
   * use methods like `clearInts` to clear the buffer of values of a given type
   * so you can fill the buffer with new values or go back to pseudo-random
   * number generation.
